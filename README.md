**Goals**<br>
I aimed to analyze the impact of patent extension on drug prices, and the movement to oppose the practice around the world.<br>

**Findings**<br>
I found that countries with the most opposition to a popular TB drug had the highest burdens of TB, and that bedaquiline and delaminid were the priciest TB medicines.<br>

**Data Collection**<br>
I collected data from the Global Drug Facility's procurement pricing data because drug pricing data was not readily available online. The patent opposition data was pulled from a resource called Patent Opposition Database<br>

**Analysis**<br>
To make the first chart, I scraped a PDF from the Global Drug Facility using PDFplumber. The map was made using a hex map downloaded for ArcGIS. <br>

**Skills**<br>
I used D3 and Scrollama to create the scrollymap, which was a large learning curve for me. I also manipulated my visualizations in Illustrator.<br>

**Challenges**<br>
With more time, I wanted to use D3 to animate the first graph as well.<br>
