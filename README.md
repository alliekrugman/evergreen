**Short description of what you aimed to accomplish**
I aimed to analyze the impact of patent extension on drug prices, and the movement to oppose the practice around the world.

**Short description of your findings**
I found that countries with the most opposition to a popular TB drug had the highest burdens of TB, and that bedaquiline and delaminid were the priciest TB medicines.

**Summary of the data collection process, with links**
I collected data from the Global Drug Facility's procurement pricing data because drug pricing data was not readily available online. The patent opposition data was pulled from a resource called Patent Opposition Database

**Overview of the data analysis process**
To make the first chart, I scraped a PDF from the Global Drug Facility using PDFplumber. The map was made using a hex map downloaded for ArcGIS. 

**A section about what new skills, approaches, etc you used, or where you grew the most during the project**
I used D3 and Scrollama to create the scrollymap, which was a large learning curve for me. I also manipulated my visualizations in Illustrator.

**A section about things you tried to do or wanted to do but did not have the skills/time (but if you have more time you might do)**
I wanted to use D3 to animate the first graph as well, but need to build my JavaScript and D3 skills.
